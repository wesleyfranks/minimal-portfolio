          I’m Wesley Franks, an IT professional with a passion for
          problem-solving through code. I’ve had the opportunity to lead a team,
          where I utilized my leadership skills to guide projects to successful
          completion. I enjoy working with cloud functions, NodeJS, and writing
          scripts that retrieve data and visualize it in spreadsheets. I’m also
          committed to clear documentation and creating video training resources
          to help others learn and grow. <br />
          <br />
          With certifications in AWS, Azure, and CompTIA Security+, I’m
          constantly expanding my skill set to deliver scalable, efficient
          solutions. Currently, I am focused on mastering cloud technologies and
          automation tools like Terraform, and I document my journey through
          blogs and training content. <br />
          <br />
          I enjoy building solutions to problems and so that is what the
          projects below are. Solutions to problems I've had in the past. I may
          take a tutorial and adapt it to my own needs.
